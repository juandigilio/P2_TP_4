The main street of the Republic of San Mangnolia's capital, Liberte et Egalite, was so peaceful and beautiful one would be hard pressed to believe the country had been at war for the past nine years.
Carved white marble graced the facades of the city's high-rise buildings. The greenery of the roadside trees and the black cast-iron lampposts mingled to create a picturesque contrast with the spring sunlight and and the clear blue sky. The cafes on the street corners were populated by students and couples, their naturally silver hair glittering as they laughed loudly.
